WEEK 7 Reflection
This week shifted gears in a way that I actually appreciated. After the tough balancing act of last week, it was a relief to have more structured support from our professor—especially when it came to understanding hashing and hash tables. The walkthroughs and guided explanations really helped take the edge off what could’ve easily been an overwhelming topic.

I was especially grateful that our professor took time to walk us through the hashing table procedures, rather than expecting us to brute force our way into understanding. That patience and guidance made a real difference. Instead of being stuck in the weeds trying to reverse-engineer logic from scratch, we got to focus on creating sound replications of a working hash table. That approach gave me a better foothold.

That said, I still don’t feel like I have a rock-solid understanding of how hashing truly works under the hood—particularly how collisions are managed or how different hashing functions affect performance. But I’m hopeful that as I continue writing and refining the code, some of those abstract concepts will start to “click” through practice and repetition.

This week was less about heavy lifting in terms of new code volume, and more about internalizing foundational mechanisms and replicating them cleanly. I tried to focus on clarity in my implementations, following the guidance we were given. As I coded, I paid attention to how each method played into the overall structure and functionality of the table, even if the “why” behind each design decision is still coming into focus.
